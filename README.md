## Sinatra Multi Frontend

This project is a Sinatra backend with multiple Vite-React frontends.

The main goal of this project is to explore how to use Yarn Workspaces.
The official documentation for Yarn Workspaces is [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspace) and [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspaces).

In the current project, I am using Workspaces for the following purposes.

1. "Install dependencies from multiple package.json files in subfolders of a single root package.json file, all in one go" (from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/))
2. Run yarn scripts from the root directory. ([here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspaces), and [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/workspace))

## When Yarn Workspace is useful for me

### In development

You can install all dependencies with just the `yarn install` on the root package.

You can run scripts on each workspace from the root package. See the root `package.json`.

### In production

You can install all dependencies with just the `yarn install` on the root package.
As a result, CI/CD scripts do not have to know anything about the project structure, improving maintainability.

You can run build scripts on each workspace from the root package.
Running `yarn workspaces run build` will run the build script on all workspaces.

### Summary

In my projects, features for sharing common code between workspaces are not the main priority.

Instead,
I like the ease of set-up and running dev and build scripts
and how the project structure can be hidden from CI/CD scripts.

## Structure of the project

1. Ruby Sinatra as the backend. (`backend`)
2. Vite React x 2 for the frontend. (`admin`, `user`)

## Setup

1. Download this repository
2. Run `yarn install` in the project root directory.
3. CD to the `backend` repository and run `bundle install`
4. Go back to the project root directory and run `yarn dev` to run the production environment. You can access the user and admin backends at http://localhost:4000 and http://localhost:4100.
5. To see how the production builds work, run `yarn build` and see what gets built â€“ all frontends should be built simultaneously.

This repository does not have a setup for deployment yet.
